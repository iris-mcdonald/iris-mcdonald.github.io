Cleveland Codes Application Mini Project

The Steps I Took

1)  Set up GitHub account
2)  Looked at Atom and Notepad++. Downloaded and decided to use Notepad++ as text editor as it seemed more straight forward for this project.
3)  Signed up for General Assembly and took the lessons on HTML and CSS.
4)  Read Mozilla "Getting Started with the Web".
5)  Copied the initial code into Notepad++, and used the run feature to test changes
6)  Worked through the changes, except for linking to my resume, and loading to GitHub.
7)  Completed workshops at Tri-C Westshore: Resumes That Get Results, Classroom to Career, and Ace That Interview
8)  Completed resume and uploaded to Google Docs. Added an anchor element to my project file, with my resume's href attribute.
9)  Read tutorials about using GitHub 10 Loaded project to GitHub, and added my notes to the Readme file.
10) Watched the video re: technical interviews

Challenges

1)  The website did not render properly in my default browser, although the project did not specify what browser to use. I downloaded Microsoft Chrome, and then it worked fine.
2)  Noticed "My to dos..." on Overview for Cleveland Codes Applicant Mini Project should be "Add a task"
3)  I had some difficulty implementing the JavaScript alert pop-up box, as I thought it must complicated. Finally, I just tried adding the alert method which required only one line of code, and it worked perfectly! That's a pretty powerful line of code!
4)  I had a major distraction while working on this project. Yellow Jackets found a hole in the siding of our house and managed to build a large nest between the floor boards in the ceiling of the room I was working in. We had a pest control service out twice to spray the nest, but after 3 weeks yellow jackets were still coming and going from their nest, and worse, coming into our family room. Every time I heard buzzing I had to get up and swat a yellow jacket or two!
5)  I am a bit confused by GitHub and GitHub pages, in terms of the correct sequence/workflow.  I think this will be quickly clarified by working through other projects.
6)  I had some difficulty sizing the background image as there's alot of options.  Also, I wanted to use a smaller image for the background, but after I re-sized it, it wouldn't let me use a re-sized image-maybe copyright issues?
